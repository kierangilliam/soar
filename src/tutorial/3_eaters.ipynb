    "That would require *sensing* walls around it, *moving* using some path finder algorithm, and some *hand-stapler* mechanism that guided the robot arm to place a stapler on a desk.\n",

It doesn't have a text editor you can use to edit files using a mouse and keyboard. It does, however, provide hooks for someone to build these things ontop of it. It manages low level process scheduling, memory management, and security. \n",

    "You can think of Soar in a similar fashion. Soar won't give you a nice library for recognizing objects from a camera feed or for moving a robot from one location to another with A*. It does, however, give you hooks to send information to the agent (I sense a wall infront of me) for internal planning and reasoning. \n",

    "### Move Operator Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the following order of preferences: I prefer to move to bonus food over normal food. I prefer to move to normal food over a blank cell. Or, `move to bonusfood > move to normalfood > move to blank`.\n",
    "\n",

    "We've already talked about the *indifferent* preference (`=`).\n",
    "If a Soar agent only has *indifferent* proposed operators, it will choose randomly amongst them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say we prefer one operator over another with the `>` sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If I see two rules where one moves me to a bonus food, and the other moves me to a normal food...\n",
    "```\n",
    "    (state <s> ^operator <bonus-operator> +\n",
    "               ^operator <normal-operator> +) \n",

    "-->\n",
    "    (<s> ^operator <bonus-operator> > <normal-operator>)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say: While moving to an empty cell or a cell with another eater is a *valid* choice, it's a *worst* choice.\n",
    "Meaning, if the only option we have is a blank cell, move there. \n",
    "Else, move to food.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "sp {select*move*prefer-normalfood \n",
    "    (state <s> ^operator <o> +) \n",

    "\n",
    "Normal food is tagged as *best* but since we have the rule saying *bonus is better than normal*, bonus food will ultimately be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preferences Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acceptable** (`+`) This must be specified anytime you want an operator to fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reject** (`-`) Strictly specify that this particular value is not a candidate for selection. \n",
    "An operator can be both *best*, *worst*, *better*, etc ***AND*** *rejected*. \n",
    "Rejection trumps everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indifferent** (`=`) Randomly choose if no other better options prevail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better** (`>`), **Worse** (`<`) Ordered preference for two operators A and B. A is better than B (A > B). Or, B is worse than A (B < A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best** (`>`) Pick this operator if there are no other operators better than it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst** (`<`) If there are no other better alternatives, pick this operator.\n",
    "\n",
