    "## Let's write it ourselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our agents haven't interacted with the outside world at all. They have only maintained an internal state that we populated manually. \n",
    "Using what we know now, we couldn't create a robot that moved through an office building to give a stapler to an employee.\n",
    "That would require *sensing* walls around it, *moving* using some path finder algorithm, and some *hand-stapler* mechanism that guided the robot arm to place a stapler on a desk.\n",
    "In Soar, you'd program the logic `if I have a stapler, and <target> is infront of me, hand them the stapler, else move to target` into the agent. \n",
    "You *wouldn't* program the actual *moving* or *sensing* however. This is because Soar is a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Soar clarifies that it is *not* an all purposed AI machine. Soar is a \"kernel\". The linux kernel, for example, isn't a full-fledged operating system. It doesn't have a GUI. It doesn't have a text editor you can use to edit files using a mouse and keyboard. It does, however, provide hooks for someone to build these things ontop of it. It manages low level process scheduling, memory management, and security. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Soar in a similar fashion. Soar won't give you a nice library for recognizing objects from a camera feed or for moving a robot from one location to another with A*. It does, however, give you hooks to send information to the agent (I sense a wall infront of me) for internal planning and reasoning. \n",
    "If rules were to fire for `wall infront` and `wall infront of me is bad` then you can have another hook to listen to that event and modify your agents real world position using the robot's motor system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IO\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending information to a Soar agent is done through an `input-link`. Receiving commands from a Soar agent is done through an `output-link`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll talk about the two phases of the Soar cycle we left out in the last lesson: input and output phase.\n",

    "## Move-To-Food Operator \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have the knowledge to write the rules for the first agent we saw: the move-to-food agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of testing the `input-link` for an eater (`(state <s> ^io.input-link.eater <e>)`), you'll want to test the `input-link` for the food around the agent (`(state <s> ^io.input-link.location.north/south/east/west.content`).\n",
    "The `content` will either be `normalfood` or `bonusfood`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the following rules:\n",
    "1. (propose) If normalfood is by me, propose I move-to-food in that direction.\n",
    "2. (propose) If bonusfood is by me, propose I move-to-food in that direction.\n",
    "3. (apply) If the move-to-food operator is selected, create an output command to move in that direction.\n",
    "4. (apply) If the move-to-food operator is selected and there's an existing completed move command, remove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "* To keep things simple, have `1` and `2` *indifferently* propose the operator so that the agent chooses where to move *at random*. Remember that if you don't specifiy this indifference, an impasse will be thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra credit:\n",
    "1. Combine `1` and `2` into a single rule using disjunctions as disucssed in the previous tutorial.\n",
    "2. Write a monitor rule that prints out the contents of the cells around the agent."

    "\n",
    "Another shortcut we can do is matching values on different children of an object.\n",
    "Example: match on `operator` with `^name` `move-to-food` *and* `^direction` `south`.\n",
    "To do this, we use parenthesis.\n",

    "#### Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Soar syntax is unlike any syntax that I work with on a regular basis.\n",

    "`matches` Answers the question, \"what rules are about to fire?\"\n",

    "## Generalized Move Operator\n",

    "The move-to-food operator we just wrote was greedy: eat whatever food is closest. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's fix the lowest hanging fruit first and make the eater move to any type of cell that's not a wall.\n",

    "Implementing the first would look like so:\n",

    "Here, the difference is `{ <content> <> wall })`. `<> wall` translates to `not wall`. \n",
    "If the value of `content` matches this rule, we again throw that value into the `<content>` variable.\n",

    "The Soar tutorial recommends to try creating the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An eater that chases another eater.\n",
    "2. An eater that tries to stay away from other eaters.\n",
    "3. An eater that systematically searches for food when empty cells surround it.\n",
    "4. ~An eater that looks ahead to see what move would be better based on what surrounds the cell it is going to move into.~\n",
    "5. ~An eater that takes advantage of the fact that bonus food comes in vertical lines, each 4 cells apart.~\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's implementation of the Eater World differs in a couple of ways from what's described in the tutorial:\n",
    "- Eaters cannot look two cells ahead, they are limited to seeing what is immediately beside them. This is why we implement *sprint* instead of *jump*.\n",
    "- The Soar tutorial has a well-defined way to place walls/food/etc on a map. This notebook randomly initializes these things. This could be extended in the `GridBuilder` class.\n",
    "- When eaters collide, they *should* both die and average their points. This in general makes for more interesting gameplay. This is not how they are currently implemented.\n",
    "- Add name and score to `eater` state (see below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to submit a PR to add one of the above items!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another TODO** that would be nice is rewriting the `runner` to build a list of world states and return that, along with the print logs, to the client. Then the states could be played in order, or you could scrub through with a [slider](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Using%20Interact.html).\n",
