    "## Move-To-Food Operator \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now have the knowledge to write the rules for the first agent we saw: the move-to-food agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of testing the `input-link` for an eater (`(state <s> ^io.input-link.eater <e>)`), you'll want to test the `input-link` for the food around the agent (`(state <s> ^io.input-link.location.north/south/east/west.content`).\n",
    "The `content` will either be `normalfood` or `bonusfood`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the following rules:\n",
    "1. (propose) If normalfood is by me, propose I move-to-food in that direction.\n",
    "2. (propose) If bonusfood is by me, propose I move-to-food in that direction.\n",
    "3. (apply) If the move-to-food operator is selected, create an output command to move in that direction.\n",
    "4. (apply) If the move-to-food operator is selected and there's an existing completed move command, remove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "* To keep things simple, have `1` and `2` *indifferently* propose the operator so that the agent chooses where to move *at random*. Remember that if you don't specifiy this indifference, an impasse will be thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra credit:\n",
    "1. Combine `1` and `2` into a single rule using disjunctions as disucssed in the previous tutorial.\n",
    "2. Write a monitor rule that prints out the contents of the cells around the agent."
