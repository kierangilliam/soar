    "The next part of the tutorial involves creating rules for *eaters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An eater is kind of like Pacman. It tries to gobble up as much food as it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "**World**\n",
    "* The eaters world is a 16 by 16 grid where each cell holds either a `eater`, `wall`, `bonusfood`, or `normalfood`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food**\n",
    "* `normalfood` (green) is worth 5 points\n",
    "* `bonusfood` (gold) is worth 10 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eaters**\n",
    "* Eaters can move `north`, `south`, `east`, or `west`. \n",
    "* They know their `X` `Y` coordinates on the grid.\n",
    "* They can sense the contents in the four squares around them.\n",
    "    You'll use this information to program different strategies for the eater to find food to eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lessons**\n",
    "* Inputs & outputs\n",
    "* Preferences\n",
    "* Theory (the kernel, design principles)\n",
    "* Syntactic sugar\n",
    "* We'll continue our dicussion on disjunctions\n",

    "## Let's write it ourselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our agents haven't interacted with the outside world at all. They have only maintained an internal state that we populated manually. \n",
    "Using what we know now, we couldn't create a robot that moved through an office building to give a stapler to an employee.\n",
    "That would require *sensing* walls around it, *moving* using some path finder algorithm, and some *hand-stapler* mechanism that guided the robot arm to place a stapler on a desk.\n",
    "In Soar, you'd program the logic `if I have a stapler, and <target> is infront of me, hand them the stapler, else move to target` into the agent. \n",
    "You *wouldn't* program the actual *moving* or *sensing* however. This is because Soar is a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Soar clarifies that it is *not* an all purposed AI machine. Soar is a \"kernel\". The linux kernel, for example, isn't a full-fledged operating system. It doesn't have a GUI. It doesn't have a text editor you can use to edit files using a mouse and keyboard. It does, however, provide hooks for someone to build these things ontop of it. It manages low level process scheduling, memory management, and security. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Soar in a similar fashion. Soar won't give you a nice library for recognizing objects from a camera feed or for moving a robot from one location to another with A*. It does, however, give you hooks to send information to the agent (I sense a wall infront of me) for internal planning and reasoning. \n",
    "If rules were to fire for `wall infront` and `wall infront of me is bad` then you can have another hook to listen to that event and modify your agents real world position using the robot's motor system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IO\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending information to a Soar agent is done through an `input-link`. Receiving commands from a Soar agent is done through an `output-link`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll talk about the two phases of the Soar cycle we left out in the last lesson: input and output phase.\n",

    "`Sensors / perception mechanism` Anything that gives an agent information about the outside world. For example, in the eaters world, we provide the agent with the perception of the food around it. If this was a robotics problem in the real world, our sensor could be a camera. We could perform object recognition from the camera feed then send that information (object name, position, etc) to the Soar agent.\n",

    "Soar agents have an object in WM called `io`. \n",
    "This `io` object has two children, `input-link` and `output-link`.\n",
    "We can add to the `output-link` as a way of creating commands.\n",
    "In this case, our command is `move`. \n",
    "Our `move` can store information itself, like the speed at which we want to move, or direction.\n",
    "\n",

    "This notebook's implementation of the Eater World differs in a couple of ways from what's described in the tutorial:\n",
    "- Eaters cannot look two cells ahead, they are limited to seeing what is immediately beside them. This is why we implement *sprint* instead of *jump*.\n",
    "- The Soar tutorial has a well-defined way to place walls/food/etc on a map. This notebook randomly initializes these things. This could be extended in the `GridBuilder` class.\n",
    "- When eaters collide, they *should* both die and average their points. This in general makes for more interesting gameplay. This is not how they are currently implemented.\n",
    "- Add name and score to `eater` state (see below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to submit a PR to add one of the above items!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another TODO** that would be nice is rewriting the `runner` to build a list of world states and return that, along with the print logs, to the client. Then the states could be played in order, or you could scrub through with a [slider](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Using%20Interact.html).\n",

    "## Top-state Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\[Below\\] has a summary of the structure of the top-state for every eater. It is a useful reference when you build your own eaters and you will probably want to make a copy of it. All of the attributes of an object appear below it in outline form, with indentation used to signify sub-objects. Possible values are listed on the same line as the attribute. - Page 94\n",
