    "That would require *sensing* walls around it, *moving* using some path finder algorithm, and some *hand-stapler* mechanism that guided the robot arm to place a stapler on a desk.\n",

It manages low level process scheduling, memory management, and security. \n",

    "### Move Operator Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the following order of preferences: I prefer to move to bonus food over normal food. I prefer to move to normal food over a blank cell. Or, `move to bonusfood > move to normalfood > move to blank`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Soar, we can do this easily using **preferences**. \n",
    "We've already talked about the *indifferent* preference (`=`).\n",
    "If a Soar agent only has *indifferent* proposed operators, it will choose randomly amongst them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say we prefer one operator over another with the `>` sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If I see two rules where one moves me to a bonus food, and the other moves me to a normal food...\n",
    "```\n",
    "    (state <s> ^operator <bonus-operator> +\n",
    "               ^operator <normal-operator> +) \n",
    "    (<bonus-operator> ^name move\n",
    "          ^content bonusfood) \n",
    "    (<normal-operator> ^name move\n",
    "          ^content << normalfood empty eater >>)\n",

    "```\n",
    "-->\n",
    "    (<s> ^operator <bonus-operator> > <normal-operator>)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also say: While moving to an empty cell or a cell with another eater is a *valid* choice, it's a *worst* choice.\n",
    "Meaning, if the only option we have is a blank cell, move there. \n",
    "Else, move to food.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sp {select*move*avoid-empty-eater \n",
    "    (state <s> ^operator <o> +) \n",
    "    (<o> ^name move\n",

    "-->\n",
    "    (<s> ^operator <o> <)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, we could instead ensure that food is picked over empty/eater cells with the \"*I like*\" operator (using `>` with only one operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sp {select*move*prefer-normalfood \n",
    "    (state <s> ^operator <o> +) \n",

    "\n",
    "Normal food is tagged as \"*I like*\" but since we have the rule saying *bonus is better than normal*, bonus food will ultimately be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preferences Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acceptable** (`+`) This must be specified anytime you want an operator to fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reject** (`-`) Strictly specify that this particular value is not a candidate for selection. \n",
    "An operator can be both *best*, *worst*, *better*, etc ***AND*** *rejected*. \n",
    "Rejection trumps everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indifferent** (`=`) Randomly choose if no other better options prevail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better** (`>`), **Worse** (`<`) Ordered preference for two operators A and B. A is better than B (A > B). Or, B is worse than A (B < A).\n",
    "\n",
    "**I like** (`>`) Pick this operator if there are no other operators better than it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I dislike** (`<`) If there are no other better alternatives, pick this operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running it\n",

    "The Soar tutorial recommends to try creating the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An eater that chases another eater.\n",
    "2. An eater that tries to stay away from other eaters.\n",
    "3. An eater that systematically searches for food when empty cells surround it.\n",
    "4. ~An eater that looks ahead to see what move would be better based on what surrounds the cell it is going to move into.~\n",
    "5. ~An eater that takes advantage of the fact that bonus food comes in vertical lines, each 4 cells apart.~\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's implementation of the Eater World differs in a couple of ways from what's described in the tutorial:\n",
    "- Eaters cannot look two cells ahead, they are limited to seeing what is immediately beside them. This is why we implement *sprint* instead of *jump*.\n",
    "- The Soar tutorial has a well-defined way to place walls/food/etc on a map. This notebook randomly initializes these things. This could be extended in the `GridBuilder` class.\n",
    "- When eaters collide, they *should* both die and average their points. This in general makes for more interesting gameplay. This is not how they are currently implemented.\n",
    "- Add name and score to `eater` state (see below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to submit a PR to add one of the above items!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another TODO** that would be nice is rewriting the `runner` to build a list of world states and return that, along with the print logs, to the client. Then the states could be played in order, or you could scrub through with a [slider](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Using%20Interact.html).\n",

    "> \\[Below\\] has a summary of the structure of the top-state for every eater. It is a useful reference when you build your own eaters and you will probably want to make a copy of it. All of the attributes of an object appear below it in outline form, with indentation used to signify sub-objects. Possible values are listed on the same line as the attribute. - Page 94\n",
