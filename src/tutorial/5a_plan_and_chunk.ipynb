    "### Planning \n",
    "> \"In simple look-ahead planning, your program will try out operators internally to evaluate them before it commits to applying them in the actual task.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the missionary problem, problem solving was internal so it didn't matter if you screwed up.\n",
    "If you made a fatal mistake, you could just rerun the program, or undo your action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, this often isn't plausible.\n",
    "If the missionaries and cannibals problem affected real world people, we couldn't just undo a fatal action.\n",
    "Instead, the agent will plan in its own head, so to speak, before taking an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning \n",
    "After we do look-ahead search, we want our agent to *learn* from what it has found.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use chunking to build rules that \"summarize the comparisons and evaluations that occur in the look-ahead\n",
    "search so that in the future the rules fire, making look-ahead search unnecessary - \n",
    "converting deliberation into reaction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chunking\n",
    "> \"[Chunking] is a form of explanation-based generalization. Within the examples in this section, chunking speeds up problem solving by creating search-control rules. In other types of problem solving, chunking creates other types of rules including elaborations, operator proposals and operator applications.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning & Learning\n",
    "> \"Soar does not create a step-by-step sequence of operators to apply blindly, \n",
    "but instead learns a set of context-dependent rules that prefer or avoid specific operators \n",
    "for states in the space. As a result, \n",
    "Soarâ€™s plans are more flexible so that plans learned for one problem may transfer to part of a second problem. \n",

    "1. **The state representation.** This includes the representation of evaluation objects that link evaluations with operators.\n",
    "2. **The initial state creation rule.** Since this problem arises as a substate, an initial state is generated automatically.\n",
    "3. **The operator proposal rules.** The only operator is evaluate-operator and it must be proposed for every tied operator.\n",
    "4. **The operator application rules.** Evaluate-operator is implemented hierarchically, like the abstract operators in TankSoar. Therefore, operator application involves a substate and substate operators.\n",
    "5. **The operator and state monitoring rules.** There are no special monitoring rules for Selection.\n",
    "6. **The desired state recognition rule.** Desired state recognition is automatic. When there are sufficient\n",
    "preferences, the decision procedure selects an operator, the impasse is resolved, and the substate is\n",
    "removed from working memory.\n",
    "7. **The failure recognition rule.** There are no failure states for this problem.\n",
    "8. **The search control rules.** These rules help guide which operator should be evaluated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Selection State Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "If the evaluation of a state will ultimately be a tag like \"success\" or \"failure\", they can be represented as an augmentation of the state (`^evaluation success`). We'll also have to include the operator that the evaluation refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be adding the following to the state \n",
    "\n",
    "â€¢ `operator <o>` the identifier of the task operator being evaluated\n",
    "â€¢ `symbolic-value success/partial-success/partial-failure/failure/indifferent`\n",
    "â€¢ `numeric-value [number]`\n",
    "â€¢ `value true` indicates that there is either a symbolic or numeric value.\n",
    "â€¢ `desired <d>` the identifier of a desired state to use for evaluation if there is one\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Selection Initial State Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, `^type tie` is added to the state during an impasse. \n",
    "We can optionally add more information to the state, like the name `selection`.\n",
    "\"This rule really isnâ€™t necessary, but will allow us to test for the name of the state instead of the impasse type in all of the remaining rules.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "    (<s> ^name selection)}\n",

    "\n",
    "> This rule uses a new bit of syntax, the :default, which tells Soar that this is a default rule. Default rules do not behave any differently than other rules; however, Soar keeps separate statistics on default rules and allows you to remove all of the non-default rules easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Selection Operator Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection problem only has one operator, the **evaluate-operator**. \n",
    "This operator looks for items that do not have an evaluation.\n",
    "It will create an evaluation link and later computes the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Selection*propose*evaluate-operator\n",
    "If the state is named selection and there is an item that does not have an evaluation with a value, \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Soar, we'd write\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sp {selection*propose*evaluate-operator \n",
    "    :default\n",
    "    (state <s> ^name selection \n",
    "               ^item <i>)\n",
    "    -{(state <s> ^evaluation <e>) \n",
    "      (<e>       ^operator   <i>\n",

    "    (<o> ^name evaluate-operator\n",
    "         ^operator <i>)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are testing that no evaluation exists on a state `<s>`.\n",
    "We also want this operator to stay selected until an evaluation is created with a value.\n",
    "This is why we also add the test `<e> ^value true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a single `evaluate-operator` will be created and applied for each of the tied operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Selection Operator Application\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the above rule, we need to create an evaluation data structure without a value.\n",
    "We will also create additional structures in WM to make application simpler.\n",
    "The end result will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(<s> ^evaluation <e> \n",
    "     ^operator   <o>)\n",
    "     \n",

    "     ^superstate         <ss> \n",
    "     ^superproblem-space <sp>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired structure `<d>` will be some data structure that matches the end goal of our task.\n",
    "For the water jug problem, that goal is the three-gallon jug having a single gallon of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the desired state to evaluate an operator. \n",
    "We can either look for a direct match to the desired state, or give a evaluation based off of how far off we are from the goal.\n",
