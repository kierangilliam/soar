    "The following notebooks will be much more condensed than the previous.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following at a high-level:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Substates** - Soar will create substates if it doesn't have the knowledge necessary to continue in the current state.\n",
    "- As an organizational tool. \n",
    "    You can use substates to organize your Soar program hierarchically.\n",
    "- As a planning tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planning** - If we think of TODO finish\n",
    "- Instead of trying\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking** - A mechanism for learning. \n",
    "- If a Soar agent figures out it can fill a jug in a few simple steps, but it took 100 missteps to get there,\n",
    "    it should be able to learn from its experience to take the simplest search path in the future (TODO:REWORD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning** - Another mechanism for learning. \n",
    "- Dynamically update preferences based on rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory** \n",
    "- Memory won't be covered in these tutorials but is covered in the official Soar tutorials. \n",

    "Episodic Memory Tidbit (Soar book, p.23):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The recent extensions to Soar were motivated by the desire to replicable capabilities that are inherent to humans but missing from Soar.\n",
    "__Our work on episodic memory was inspired in part by the movie *Memento*, directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2000.__ \n",
    "Though it isn't a scientific study of the effect of the loss of the ability to form new episodic memories, \n",
    "*Memento* is a relatively accurate depiction of the cognitive deficits faced by a human with anterograde amnesia.\n",
    "It dramatizes the effect of this loss, which prevents the protagonist from pursuing a productive life. \n",
    "Most AI systems are crippled in exactly the same way."
